                Greetings, everyone! Allow me to introduce myself—I'm <span class="red">Navratan, currently a fourth-year undergraduate student pursuing my B.Tech at MAIT</span>. I'm passionate about the world of software, and I'm eagerly looking forward to forging a rewarding career in this exciting field. With a solid foundation in FrontEnd Development and proficiency in programming languages such as C++ and Python, I've been crafting innovative websites tailored to meet the needs of businesses and customers alike. 

But that's not all—my journey extends beyond just web development. I've immersed myself in the world of competitive programming, having <span class="red">solved over 500 challenging Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions across various coding platforms</span>. My dedication to continuous learning and problem-solving has been a driving force in my software journey.

In addition to my technical pursuits, <span class="red">I've also been engaged in teaching for the past five years within an organization</span>. Sharing knowledge and helping others understand the intricacies of software development has been a fulfilling part of my journey.

As we embark on this journey together, I'm excited to share my insights, experiences, and passion for software with all of you. Let's explore and learn together in the ever-evolving world of technology.
